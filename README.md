The goal of this project to perform an explorotary analysis to find interesting insights and develop an inital scoring system to rate counties in the state of Massachusetts based on the number of crashes subsetted by multiple factors such as (driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs, whether the driver used a seat belt, whether the traffic device malfunctioned, etc..)


Files:
MVC_Mass.rmd: Contains all the analysis done in R. Also contains the code behind the scoring system.
